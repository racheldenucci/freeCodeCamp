                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST or Webb) is an orbiting infrared observatory 
                        that will complement and extend the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope, with longer wavelength 
                        coverage and greatly improved sensitivity. The longer wavelengths enable Webb to look much closer to the 
                        beginning of time and to hunt for the unobserved formation of the first galaxies, as well as to look inside 
                        dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today.</p>
                        <p>Webb will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.
                             It will study every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after
                              the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to 
                              the evolution of our own Solar System.
                        </p>
                        <p>Webb was formerly known as the "Next Generation Space Telescope" (NGST); it was renamed in Sept. 
                            2002 after a former NASA administrator, <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/whois.html">James Webb</a>.</p>
